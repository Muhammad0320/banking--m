Day 8 🚀 :  This error is an elusive one which I've tried infite number of possible solutions but everything was futile; I just want a mongoose pre 'findOneAndUpdate' to check if an account is blocked it should add a _block field w/  a value of true.
Then on a pre /^find/ hook it should check for account that the _block is true it should remove from the query result. 

And I can't just get it done.
